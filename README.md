CASR stands for Cubesat Amateur S-band Radio, and is an open-source S-Band radio for CubeSats

The objective of this project is primarily educational. The design of the S-Band radio and antenna system achieves this goal in two ways: the capstone members get to learn about and design a radio frequency system for space applications, and even more importantly, the design will then be open sourced and available for any student, design society or young professionals to build, test and even improve the design.

This project also solved an accessibility problem: current off-the-shelf transceiver systems cost upwards of $15 000, making the use of this frequency band very expensive for student groups and therefore, was disregarded in most designs. With an open sourced solution with a total cost of below $1000, the use of S-Band in lower end systems will greatly increase.

Lastly, this project aims to provide a communication method for low cost CubeSats that can produce much higher data rates than alternative options such as UHF or VHF. This is particularly important for our main customer, as will be explained in detail in the following section.
